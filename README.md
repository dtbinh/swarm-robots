# Abstract:
A common distinction of marsupial mammals like a kangaroo is that the mother carries around the child in a pouch. Inspired by this concept from nature is the idea of marsupial robots. In this paper a larger multi-terrain "mother robot" and smaller versatile "baby robots" are designed. The mother robot would carry in its interior the baby robots through a treacherous and rugged terrain to a central rescue location, providing rapid, efficient and a sheltered transportation. The baby robots can then come out and start urban search and rescue by locating and helping people from a collapsed or damaged structure, where it is risky for humans or rescue dogs to go. Once the job of delivering the baby robots is complete, the mother robot acts as a "base station". It also has the task of transporting the baby robots back to safety once the mission is complete. In this paper we have designed the mother and baby robots which are suitable for urban search and rescue mission.
